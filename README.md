<h2>Ticket Workflow Steps</h2>

<h3 align="center">Submission</h3>
<br />
<p>
  The user, Ken, submits a new support request:
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h3 align="center">Assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support technician John Doe signs into the help desk portal.

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Upon reviewing the ticket, John identifies it as a critical Sev-A issue and forwards it to the System Administrator team.
</p>
<p>
  He also adds an internal note to document the action taken:

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h3 align="center">Troubleshooting</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Jane Doe, a System Administrator, logs into her account:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Jane investigates the issue and updates John with her findings.
</p>
<p>
  After resolving the problem, she changes the ticket status to “resolved”:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  John logs in and sees that Jane has left a resolution note and that the ticket is now marked as closed:
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

<p>
  This was a basic walkthrough of how a user opens a ticket, how it's routed, and how team members communicate to resolve it.
</p>
<p>
  In real-world situations, tickets might need to be transferred across departments, prioritized differently based on urgency, or escalated to someone with more technical expertise depending on business needs.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully, this walkthrough gave you a clearer idea of how tickets are handled from beginning to end. In a typical workday, help desk staff may deal with anywhere from a handful to over a hundred tickets, depending on company size and industry.
